Thanks for using forgot_password!

In attempt to be flexible enough to work with multiple login systems (mainly restful-authentication and its ancestors), this plugin will generate a new controller to handle forgotten passwords.  Your user model must have accessors for password and password_confirmation, and handle its own password encryption.  I assume most people are using technoweenie's excellent restful-authentication plugin, so if you are you probably won't have any problems.

Usage:

ruby script/generate forgot_password <password-model-name> <user-model-name>

In most cases, that's probably:

ruby script/generate forgot_password password user

then run rake db:migrate and enjoy :)
